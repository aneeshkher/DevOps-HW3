### Setup  
For this asignment, I used the [express.js](http://expressjs.com/) framework to start two instances of a web server listening on ports `3000` and `3001` respectively. Since the goal of this assignment was to learn about caching and queues, I used [Redis](http://redis.io/) as an in memory data structure storage, to simulate the cache. For simulating a proxy server, I used the [http-proxy](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy) node.js module to redirect all requests to one of the express.js servers.
